### Requirements

* JDK 1.6 or later
* Maven 2.0.9 or later

### Environment set up

This project uses some open source libraries that are not available in the
 default Maven central (repo1.maven.org). All linked artifacts are available in
 repository http://oss.arcusys.com/mvn/content/groups/public. That repository
 is specified in <repositories> element of this project, but because our parent
 pom is also located in that repository, we need to fetch it first by
 invoking a special 'bootstrap' pom:
 
	mvn -f etc/bootstrap/pom.xml dependency:resolve
	
If you want to use tasks of Maven Liferay Plugin (already configured in the
 project), you need to specify some local configuration properties such
 as location of the Liferay installation. The recommended way is to specify
 properties in a Maven Profile defined in ~/.m2/settings.xml.

An example of specifying liferay properties in ~/.m2/settings.xml:

	<settings>
		<profiles>
			<profile>
				<id>liferay61</id>
				<properties>
					<liferay.home>${user.home}/opt/liferay/liferay-portal-6.1</liferay.home>
					<liferay.auto.deploy.dir>${liferay.home}/deploy</liferay.auto.deploy.dir>
				</properties>
			</profile>
		</profiles>
		
		<!-- ... -->
		<activeProfiles>
			<activeProfile>liferay61</activeProfile>
		</activeProfiles>
	</settings>
	
The profile can be activated by various ways:
1. By using settings.xml/<activeProfiles> (see the example above)
2. By defining rule in <profile>/<activation>
3. By using the command line option -P

### Building the war

Simple invoke the appropriate Maven life cycle: 'compile' will build sources,
 'package' will build the war (includes widgetset compilation) and 'install'
 will install the package to the local m2 repository (cache). In other words,
 to build the project you should type the following command:

	$ mvn install

To deploy the war to a Liferay instance, type the following command: 

	$ mvn liferay:deploy

If something goes wrong, try cleaning the project first:

	$ mvn clean
